<h1>Project Description: </h1>
<p>The majority of the time, Queue Management for the Heath Division industry is a manual procedure. It might also be regarded as one of the largest supply chain networks, with a variety of stakeholders like patients, Doctors, laboratory staff and etc. The suggested solution aims to centralize the process and address frequent problems with the current method. Wherever possible, the system would be automated to cut down on the steps required to complete a given activity and to make the process considerably simpler.  patients, Doctors, laboratory staff and nurses  would be the major stakeholders, or rather, users, of the system. The management would be in charge of the system's fundamental but crucial data and policies.
Nowadays, many people are close with WhatsApp social media, so this system mainly manages queues in hospitals by providing token number users through WhatsApp API.
The system must be web-based and simple to use due to the nature of the Medical center. Because of this, Administrators are given access to the system via a mobile application just like patients, while management and Health staff would have access via a web application with space for expansion as needed. this  application is mobile responsive web site.
The system attends to challenges that are experienced in the sector in addition to fulfilling customer requirements. Because the system is intended to eliminate unnecessary intermediaries, it has made it possible for many stakeholders to interact and communicate directly with key parties using a variety of features.
